       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'text.txt'}, page_content='\"Mother\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Meghan Trainor (pictured) from the deluxe edition of her fifth major-label studio album, Takin\\' It Back (2022). She wrote the song with Sean Douglas, and its producers, Gian Stone, and her brother Justin. Epic Records released it as the lead single on March 27, 2023. A pop song with doo-wop influences, \"Mother\" interpolates \"Mr. Sandman\". Inspired by men who said Trainor\\'s pregnancy would end her career, the song is about women\\'s empowerment; she asks the male subject to stop mansplaining and to listen to her. Critics were complimentary about the composition but criticized the use of the term \"mother\". The song reached the top 30 in Belgium, Ireland, Suriname, and the United Kingdom. Charm La\\'Donna directed the music video, which stars Kris Jenner; critics praised the fashion choices and described it as glamorous. Trainor performed the song on Today, Capital\\'s Summertime Ball, and the Timeless Tour (2024). (This article is part of a featured topic: Takin\\' It Back.)')]"
