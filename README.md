# üß† LangChain Learning Lab

Welcome to the **LangChain Learning Lab** ‚Äì a hands-on repository to explore how Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with real-world data using the LangChain framework.

---

## üöÄ About This Project

This repo is built for learning and showcasing how to use LangChain to build LLM-powered applications. Through step-by-step notebooks, you‚Äôll learn how to:
- Load and process documents from various sources
- Chain prompts and outputs for dynamic LLM interactions
- Use tools, agents, and memory
- Store and query data using vector stores
- Build real-world mini-projects
